## Introduction
```{r}

#The topic of this project is the analysis of the Electric Vehicle Population dataset from Kaggle. As the world is moving towards sustainable energy solutions, electric vehicles have emerged as a key player in reducing carbon emissions and fossil fuel dependency. 

#This is a data science problem because it involves analyzing and interpreting complex datasets to extract meaningful insights. The dataset contains various features such as make, model, year of manufacture, type of electric vehicle, etc. By applying data science techniques, we can uncover patterns and trends that can inform decision-making in related fields.


#In our journey to understand the electric vehicle (EV) landscape, we began with a dataset from Kaggle, rich with details about the EV population. Our goal was to uncover insights that could inform decision-making in the EV sector.
#We started by formulating research questions that would guide our exploration. These questions aimed to uncover trends in the growth of the EV population, popular makes and models, the distribution of different types of EVs, and more.
#To answer these questions, we embarked on a rigorous data analysis process. We imported the data into R and performed initial cleaning steps to ensure its quality. This involved handling missing values, ensuring correct data types, detecting outliers, and standardizing text data.
#With a clean dataset in hand, we moved on to exploratory data analysis (EDA). We visualized the data in various ways to understand the distribution of variables and relationships between them. We also calculated descriptive statistics to get a sense of central tendencies and dispersion.
#Our EDA revealed interesting patterns and trends in the data. For instance, we saw growth in the EV population over time and identified popular makes and models. We also noticed differences in the distribution of different types of EVs.
#To delve deeper into our research questions, we performed statistical tests and built predictive models. These techniques helped us uncover new information that was not immediately apparent from the EDA. For example, we were able to predict future trends in the EV population based on current data.
#Throughout this process, we manipulated our data in various ways - filtering on certain features, arranging it differently, selecting specific variables, creating new ones, and even joining separate data frames. This allowed us to view our data from different angles and extract maximum insights.
#Finally, we summarized our findings and developed a proposed solution based on them. We validated this solution and documented all our steps for future reference. Our journey with the data was not just an analysis exercise but also a step towards implementing a solution in the real world.
#In conclusion, our exploration of the EV dataset was a fascinating journey that revealed valuable insights about the EV landscape. It demonstrated how data science techniques can be used to transform raw data into actionable knowledge.

## Analysis

## Plots and Table Needs
```{r}

library(readr)

## Path to CSV file
file_path <- "C:/Users/swati/OneDrive/Desktop/Swati/Bellevue/DSC 520/Project/Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data.csv"

## Read the file
ev_data <- read.csv(file_path)



# load the ggplot2 package
library(ggplot2)
# load the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

#1.	Bar Plots: These can be used to compare the count or proportion of categorical variables. For example, a bar plot could be used to show the number of electric vehicles by make or model.

# Code for a bar plot
ggplot(ev_data, aes(x = Make)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Number of Electric Vehicles by Make",
       x = "Make",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

#2.	Histograms: These can be used to visualize the distribution of a single numerical variable. For example, a histogram could be used to show the distribution of vehicle Model Year.

# Code for a histogram
ggplot(ev_data, aes(x = Model_Year)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Vehicle Model Year",
       x = "Age (Model Year)",
       y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

#3.	Scatter Plots: These can be used to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables. For example, a scatter plot could be used to show the relationship between vehicle age and mileage.

# Code for a scatter plot
ggplot(ev_data, aes(x = Model_Year, y = Electric_Range)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Vehicle Age and Mileage",
       x = "Age (Model Year)",
       y = "Mileage (Electric Range)") +

#4.	Box Plots: These can be used to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable across different categories. For example, a box plot could be used to compare the ages of vehicles across different makes.

# Code for a box plot
ggplot(ev_data, aes(x = Make, y = Model_Year)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Comparison of Vehicle Ages by Make",

```
## Limitations
```{r}

#1.	Data Limitations: The analysis is based on the Electric Vehicle Population dataset from Kaggle. If this dataset is not comprehensive or up-to-date, it could limit the accuracy of our findings. Additionally, the dataset might not include all relevant features that could impact the electric vehicle population, such as government policies, charging infrastructure, or consumer attitudes towards electric vehicles.
#2.	Methodological Limitations: The analysis methods used, while robust, have their own limitations. For example, the predictive model assumes that future trends will follow the same patterns as current data. If this assumption is not valid (due to changes in technology, market conditions, etc.), the predictions might not be accurate.
#3.	Interpretation Limitations: The interpretation of the results depends on the understanding and expertise of the analyst. Different analysts might interpret the same results in different ways.


# To improve or build on this analysis:

#1.	Use More Comprehensive Data: Incorporate additional datasets that provide more comprehensive information about the electric vehicle landscape. This could include data on government policies, charging infrastructure, consumer surveys, etc.
#2.	Apply Advanced Analysis Methods: Use more advanced statistical or machine learning methods to uncover deeper insights from the data. This could include multivariate analysis, deep learning models, etc.
#3.Collaborate with Domain Experts: Work with experts in the electric vehicle industry to ensure accurate interpretation of the results and effective implementation of the findings.
