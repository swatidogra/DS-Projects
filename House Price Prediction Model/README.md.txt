## Project Details
- **Project Title**: House Price Prediction Model Using Machine Learning Techniques
- **Author**: Swati Dogra
- **Date**: 2/2/2025

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices using the House Prices – Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from Kaggle. The project aims to develop accurate and consistent predictions to aid real estate agencies, homebuyers, and investors in making well-informed decisions.

## Project Objectives
Develop a predictive model to estimate house prices based on various features.

Evaluate the performance of different machine learning models.

Provide insights into the factors influencing house prices.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the House Prices – Advanced Regression Techniques dataset from Kaggle. It consists of 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. The target variable is SalePrice, representing the sale price of houses.

## Models Used
Linear Regression

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

## Data Exploration
Distribution of Sale Prices: Most house prices range between $100,000 and $200,000, with a skewed right distribution and some outliers above $500,000.

Above Ground Living Area vs. Sale Price: Sale prices increase with larger living areas, typically ranging from 1000 to 3000 square feet.

Overall Quality vs. Sale Price: Higher quality homes are priced higher, with mid-quality homes generally falling within the $100,000 to $300,000 range.

Sale Price by Neighborhood: Most neighborhoods in Ames, Iowa, have house prices between $100,000 and $300,000.

## Model Evaluation
Actual vs. Predicted Prices: Comparison of actual house prices with predicted prices using the different models.

Residuals vs. Predicted Prices: Analysis of residuals to evaluate model accuracy and detect any biases.

Model Performance Comparison: Evaluation of models based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results
Linear Regression: MAE of approximately 24,466 and RMSE of approximately 39,213.

Random Forest: MAE of approximately 20,245 and RMSE of approximately 30,299.

Gradient Boosting: MAE of approximately 20,177 and RMSE of approximately 30,394.

Gradient Boosting and Random Forest models provided the most accurate predictions.

## Future Work
Incorporate additional data sources, such as economic indicators and market trends.

Explore neural networks and deep learning models.

Implement techniques like SHAP for model interpretability.

Expand the model to predict house prices in different geographic regions.

## Ethical Considerations
Ensure data privacy and security.

Mitigate biases in the model.

Maintain transparency about model limitations and potential errors.
