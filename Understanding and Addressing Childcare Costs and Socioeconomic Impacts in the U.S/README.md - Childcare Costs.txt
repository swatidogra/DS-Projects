# Understanding and Addressing Childcare Costs and Socioeconomic Impacts in the U.S.

## Overview
This project investigates childcare costs across different regions in the United States, exploring their impact on household budgets and related socioeconomic indicators. By analyzing various data points, the study aims to provide insights into the financial burden on parents and guardians, and suggest solutions to address these challenges.

## Project Details
- Project Title: Understanding and Addressing Childcare Costs and Socioeconomic Impacts in the U.S.
- Author: Swati Dogra
- Date: 12/21/2024

## Objectives
- To analyze and understand the variations in childcare costs across different regions and age groups.
- To explore the impact of childcare costs on household budgets and socioeconomic indicators.
- To provide actionable insights and recommendations for policymakers, childcare providers, and parents.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was sourced from the National Database of Childcare Prices provided by the U.S. Department of Labor - Women's Bureau. It includes data on median childcare prices, employment trends, household income, and other related socioeconomic factors.

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the data to uncover patterns and relationships.
3. Model Building: Developing regression models including Logistic Regression, K-Means and Correlation Analysis.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the ROC curve to determine classification performance. Measured using correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson's r) and p-values to understand the strength and significance of relationships between variables.
5. Insights and Recommendations: Summarizing findings and providing actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

## Results
The analysis revealed significant variations in childcare costs across different states and age groups, with center-based care generally being more expensive than family childcare. Gender income disparities persist, with female median earnings consistently lower than male median earnings, affecting household financial dynamics and the ability to afford childcare. Additionally, variations in unemployment rates and labor force participation between genders and age groups highlight how childcare responsibilities impact workforce engagement. These findings emphasize the need for affordable childcare options to support working families.

## Conclusion
This project successfully analyzed childcare costs and their socioeconomic impacts in the U.S. The findings suggest significant regional disparities and the need for policies that support affordable childcare. By raising awareness and providing practical insights, this analysis aims to influence policymakers, childcare providers, and parents in making informed decisions.

## Future Work
- Extending the analysis to include more comprehensive data on childcare support programs and their effectiveness.
- Exploring the impact of specific regional policies on childcare affordability.
- Implementing real-time data collection and analysis for continuous monitoring and improvement.
