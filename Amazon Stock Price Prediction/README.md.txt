# Predicting Amazon Stock Price using Regression Models

## Overview
This project aims to develop predictive models to predict Amazon stock price based on past 5 years of data downloaded from NASDAQ website. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can provide accurate price predictions to assist investors.


## Project Details
- **Project Title**: Predicting Amazon Stock Price using Regression Models
- **Author**: Swati Dogra
- **Date**: 12/21/2024

## Objectives
- To analyze and preprocess the dataset containing Amazon historic stock prices.
- To build and evaluate regression models for predicting Amazon Stock prices.
- To compare the performance of different models and select the best one.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project was sourced from NASDAQ. It contains information for past 5 years of Amazon stock and its performance with High, Low, Close price for a particular day. 

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the data to uncover patterns and relationships.
3. **Model Building**: Developing regression models including Linear Regression, ARIMA, and LSTM.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
5. **Model Selection**: Comparing the models and selecting the one with the best performance.

## Results
The Random Forest model outperformed the other models with an MAE of X and an MSE of Y. The model demonstrated its ability to provide accurate predictions for Amazon stock price.

## Conclusion
This project successfully developed predictive models for estimating Amazon stock price. The LSTM model was identified as the most effective, providing accurate and reliable predictions. These results can be valuable for various stakeholders.

## Future Work
- Extending the analysis to other stocks and financial instruments.
- Implementing real-time prediction models for intraday trading.
- Integrating additional data sources (e.g., social media sentiment, economic indicators) for more 
comprehensive predictions.
